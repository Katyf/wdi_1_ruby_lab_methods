# Assignment Name (Ruby String Lab)

## Objectives

By the end of this, students should be able to:

- Objective 1
- Objective 2
- Objective 3

## Instructions

Include explict step-by-step instructions about the goals of the assignment, and how to run the code.

Make sure to wrap section of code in appropriate markdown like `ls -al`, and denote the language as below for longer sections:

```ruby
x = 2
y = 3
puts x + y
```

## Bonus (Optional Section)

### Spiral Path

Write a function called "spiral" that takes an NxM (2d) array as input and returns a "spiral" path through the array, starting in the upper-left corner and moving clockwise.  Use the  language of your choice.

For example (in Ruby), if

```ruby
array = [[1,2,3],
         [8,9,4],
         [7,6,5]]
```

then

```ruby
spiral(array) # => [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
```

It should work on any NxM array, so don't assume the input is a square array.  However, every row will have the same number of elements.
